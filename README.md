# Spring Cognito Login

Simple web service that uses AWS Cognito to handle sign in and sign up.
Be sure to check and subtitute the application properties with your own secrets to run the application properly.

```.env
aws.secret.key=your-key
aws.secret.id=your-id
aws.region=your-region
cognito.user-pool-id=your-user-pool
cognito.client-id=your-client-id
cognito.client-secret=your-client-secret
```
